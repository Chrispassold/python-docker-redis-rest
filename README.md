# python-docker-redis-rest

Python application with redis and docker for environment

## Requirements
- Docker (Windows or Linux)

## Getting started

First, you need to build the docker image => `docker-compose build`

Then you can run the image and create the container => `docker-compose up -d`

If any file in source changes, docker will rebuild and re-run.

If you want to stop the container => `docker-compose down`
